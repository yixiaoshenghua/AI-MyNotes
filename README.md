# MyNotes
Here I give an abstract definition of artificial intelligence, hoping to inspire future research directions.

I call an object intelligent, because it can behave like human, has the ability to complete complex tasks, and has human thinking ability and emotional activities, anyone observing it from the outside has the same mind as human knowing complex psychological activities such as games, tricks, deception, at least on the outside. Until the moment when it is judged that he is non-intelligent, no one can know the internal operating principle of his intelligence, then such an object is intelligent in terms of completeness.
I also call this intelligence definition "observable artificial intelligence".

在这里我给出人工智能一个抽象的定义，希望对未来的研究方向有所启发

我称一个对象具有智能，是在他表现得能够像人一样，具备完成复杂任务的能力，并且从表面上看具备人的思维能力和情感活动，任何人从外表观测他都具有如同人类一样的心智，知道博弈、诡计、欺骗等复杂的心理活动，至少从外表上看是这样，并且直到判断他是非智能的时刻为止，任何人都无法获知他的产生智能的内部运行原理，那么这样的对象从完备性上看是智能的。
这样的智能定义方法我也称它为“可观测人工智能”。
